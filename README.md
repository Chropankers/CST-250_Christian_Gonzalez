CST-250: Christian Gonzalez
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the course Programming in C# II. This repository serves as a central location to store and organize my assignments.

Overview
In each directory, you'll find a README.md file that provides details about the contents and purpose of the folder. These READMEs are designed to help you navigate through the various assignments and resources.

Professor: 
Welcome! I hope the layout of this repository meets your standards. The README files are intended to guide you smoothly through the different assignments. Should you have any suggestions or issues, please feel free to let me know.

Classmates: Please refer to the folders, which are organized by Topic Week and by Assignment, Milestone, or other specific notes. Each root folder contains its own README for easy reference.

Contact:
If you encounter any difficulties or have questions, feel free to email me at Chropankers@gmail.com. I regularly check this email, so it's the best way to reach me quickly. I appreciate your visit to my repository and hope you find the materials helpful!
