# CST-250_Christian_Gonzalez
A place for me to store my assignments for the class Programming in C# II. There will be README files in each directory to categorize what each directory is and the relevant files within.

Hello! If you are reading this, then you have reached the Github repository for me, Christian Gonzalez, and will likely either be my professor or a classmate
with whom I am working. If not, then I guess you found something that won't be that interesting to you lol. Prof, welcome and I hope that my layout isn't 
insufficiently orderly for you, and I hope to have my README files get you through the different assignemnts without issue. Student, whoever you are, please 
look for the folders as they are marked, by Topic week and by Assignment, Milestone, or otherwise noted. There will be readmes for all root folders. Refer to
them, and if you have trouble email me at Chropankers@gmail.com. I would offer my work email but I check my personal daily, so send messages there and I am far
more likely to respond than elsewhere. Otherwise, thank you for visiting my Repo!
